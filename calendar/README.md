Note: I have not debug the replies for the add,edit,delete, so it'll always say that it passed when in fact it didn't. A failed delete will fail to delete despite it saying it passed. It will work according to the right way, but just that it'll spit out success everytime regardless. 

Creative Portion:
Registration (not on the rubric)
Actually having the events show up on the calendar(not on the rubric either)

basically, if you plug in another username in Get user calendar with and press get both calendars, it will put all events on there for that month on there.
